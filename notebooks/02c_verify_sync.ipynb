Detects which dates were refreshed by comparing last_updated_at timestamps\n2. Compare source vs mart counts for those dates\n3. Verify last_updated_at timestamps show the refreshed partitions are newer\n4. Confirm all other dates remain unchanged (older timestamps)\n\n## Parameters:\n- `catalog`: Target Unity Catalog (default: main)\n- `schema`: Schema name (default: your_schema)\n\n## Auto-detection Strategy:\nFinds partitions where last_updated_at is NEWER than the baseline (earliest timestamp in the table).\nThis identifies the partitions that were refreshed in the most recent dbt run."
